# Overview
This project aims to apply the knowledge gained from the course by designing, implementing, and deploying a containerized web application using Kubernetes (K8s) orchestration and Docker. The project focuses on enhancing an existing web application backed by a MySQL database with added features for configuration, security, and persistent data management. By leveraging GitHub Actions, Docker images will be automatically built and published to Amazon ECR, while the application will be deployed on an Amazon EKS cluster. The project also covers key aspects such as cost optimization, high availability, and scalability, as well as security and operational challenges in cloud-native environments.
